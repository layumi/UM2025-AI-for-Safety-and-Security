# üñ•Ô∏è Lab Manual: Natural Language Analysis with Large Language Models

## üéØ Objectives
- Learn how to use large language models (LLMs) for **summarization**, **sentiment analysis**, and **interrogation simulation**.  
- Practice **prompt engineering** instead of programming.  
- Understand the **potential benefits and risks** of using AI in law enforcement and public opinion monitoring.  

---

## üîß Preparation
1. Each group should have access to a computer with internet connection.  
2. Use any available LLM platform:  

3. Copy the provided **case texts (in Chinese)** to be used as inputs.

**Prompt Template (English):**
> Please summarize the following police report. Extract the key information in bullet points, including:  
> - Time  
> - Location  
> - People involved  
> - Incident details  
> - Property loss  

**Reflection Questions:**
- If you remove ‚Äúextract time and location,‚Äù does the model still capture them?  
- Are there any errors or missing details in the summary?

**Prompt Template (English):**
1.  
> You are an interrogator. The suspect has admitted theft but refuses to explain the motive. Please generate **3 follow-up questions** that could help reveal the hidden motive.  

2.  
> Based on the suspect‚Äôs background and statements, what information might he still be **hiding**?  

**Reflection Questions:**
- Are the AI-generated questions logical and useful?  
- If you slightly change the wording of the prompt, how does the model‚Äôs response change?

## üìä Lab Report Requirements
Each group should submit a short report (1‚Äì2 pages) including:  
1. Screenshots of prompts and outputs for each task.  
2. A summary of what types of prompts worked best.  
3. Critical reflection: What problems or risks did you observe in AI-generated results?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- **Privacy:** All case texts are fictional. Do not use real personal data.  
- **Critical Thinking:** Treat AI outputs as suggestions, not absolute truth.  
- **Exploration:** Feel free to try different prompts or different LLMs and compare the results.
